# About the Project
A "hitchhiker's guide" to new living environments. Moving is one of the most stressful events in a person's life, and often leads to the costly mistakes typically associated with it. Footsteps aims to fix that, by giving users different features to use:
* The ability to add their experiences
* Optimal spots for things like groceries and recreation
* Living situations
* Safest ways to walk

and more sorted by demographic.
